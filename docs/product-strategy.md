# School Management Platform – Product and Architecture Strategy

## 1. Vision and Core Outcomes
The platform centralizes academic, administrative, and financial operations for schools. It should deliver:
- **Single source of truth** for student and staff records, academic history, finances, and events.
- **Role-aware experience** that adapts to Admin, Teacher, Student, and Finance teams while maintaining data security.
- **Automated insights** into performance, compliance, and financial standing through dashboards and scheduled reports.

## 2. User Segments and Primary Journeys
| Persona | Primary Goals | Key Modules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Admin** | onboard community, manage academics/finance access, oversee compliance | Registration, Academics, Staff, Finance, Reports |
| **Teacher** | manage classrooms, capture assessments, communicate outcomes | Classes, Attendance, Question Bank, Assignments |
| **Student** | monitor progress, complete assessments, maintain profile | Profile, Results, Tests, Assignments, E-Library |
| **Finance Officer** | reconcile payments, generate statements, forecast budgets | Payments, Sanctions, Income/Expense Ledger |

### Login and Navigation Flow (All Personas)
1. **Authentication**
   - Email/username + password with optional MFA.
   - SSO-ready (SAML/OAuth) for institutions with identity providers.
   - Passwordless invite links for first-time users (admins create accounts).
2. **Authorization and Context Setup**
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) seeds the user’s default workspace (school, session, term).
   - Feature flags/gatekeeping for modules not yet purchased or enabled.
3. **Personalized Dashboard**
   - Snapshot cards for key actions: pending registrations (Admin), attendance submissions (Teacher), outstanding fees (Finance), new grades (Student).
4. **Global navigation** segmented into major domains: **Individuals**, **Academic Performance**, **Events**, **Financials**, **Resources**.

## 3. Platform Architecture
### 3.1 Application Layers
- **Client (Next.js)**: Server-side rendering for dashboards, client components for interactive tables and forms. Use Next Auth for sessions.
- **API Gateway (Next.js App Router + Route Handlers)**: Handles REST/GraphQL endpoints, orchestrates business logic.
- **Core Services**
  - **Identity & Access**: authentication, roles, permissions, audit trails.
  - **People Registry**: unified student/staff profile management, documents, guardians.
  - **Academics**: courses, classes, attendance, assessments, automatic GPA/CGPA computation.
  - **Finance**: fee structures, payments, sanctions, scholarships, income/expense ledger.
  - **Content & Resources**: assignments, e-library assets, exam/test question bank.
- **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM. Tables partitioned by domain for maintainability.
- **Event Bus / Jobs**: queue for notifications (email/SMS), report generation, grade calculations.

### 3.2 Cross-Cutting Concerns
- **Audit Logging** for all CRUD operations on sensitive data.
- **Data Residency** using institution-level tenancy (school_id column), enabling multi-school support.
- **Validation** with shared schema (Zod/TypeScript types) for consistency across client/server.
- **File Storage** using S3-compatible service for photos, certificates, documents.
- **Analytics** using scheduled jobs to precompute dashboards and send alerts.

## 4. Data Model Blueprint
The following high-level schema guides detailed modeling (all records scoped by `school_id`).

### Core Entities
- `users` (auth credentials, role assignments)
- `people` (common bio data, linked to users when applicable)
- `students`, `staff` (extended attributes)
- `guardians` and `student_guardian_links`
- `classes`, `subjects`, `enrollments`
- `assessments` (tests, exams, assignments) with components for scores, weighting
- `attendance_records`
- `fees`, `dues`, `payments`, `scholarships`
- `sanctions` (disciplinary or financial)
- `documents` (certificates, medical reports)
- `library_assets`, `borrow_transactions`
- `question_bank_items`, `question_sets`
- `events` (calendar, extracurricular activities)
- `payroll_runs`, `salary_components`

### Derived Views & Automations
- **Performance snapshots**: materialized views for term CGPA, grade distribution.
- **Financial standing**: outstanding balances by student, department, and overall.
- **Compliance reports**: expired documents, pending sanctions, attendance anomalies.

## 5. Module Breakdown and User Journeys
### 5.1 Individuals
- **Directory** with advanced filters (status, department, class, role, sanctions).
- **Profile Pages** for students and staff with tabs: Bio, Academics, Financials, Documents.
- **Bulk Operations**: CSV import/export, mass status updates, communications.

### 5.2 Academics & Performance
1. **Teacher Workflow**
   - View assigned classes ➜ take attendance ➜ create/update assessments ➜ enter scores ➜ publish results.
   - Integrate question bank into tests/assignments; support randomization and timed exams.
2. **Admin Oversight**
   - Configure grading scales, weightings, academic calendar.
   - Approve published results, trigger report card generation.
3. **Student Experience**
   - Access timetable, assessments, feedback.
   - Run analytics: trend lines, CGPA computation, degree classification predictions.

### 5.3 Financials
- **Fee Management**: define fee items per session/term/class; schedule invoices.
- **Payment Tracking**: log receipts (manual/bank integration), handle partial payments, scholarships.
- **Sanctions & Waivers**: issue fines or restrictions; workflow for resolution.
- **Reporting**: income vs expenses, outstanding balances, cash flow forecasts.
- **Payroll**: staff salary structures, deductions, approvals, payout logs.

### 5.4 Events & Communication
- Academic calendar with reminders.
- Notifications center (email/SMS/in-app) with templates per event (missed attendance, fee reminders).
- Event registrations and attendance for extracurricular activities.

### 5.5 Resources & E-Library
- Curated digital library with categories, permissions, download tracking.
- Assignment submissions with plagiarism checks (integration-ready).

## 6. Integration and Extensibility Plan
- **API Access**: provide secure API keys/webhooks for SIS/LMS interoperability.
- **Third-Party Services**: payment gateways, SMS providers, document verification.
- **Plugin Architecture**: allow institutions to enable optional modules (transport, hostel management) later.

## 7. Implementation Roadmap
1. **Foundation (Milestone 1)**
   - Set up authentication, RBAC, tenant-aware data model.
   - Build core directories (students, staff) with CRUD and document upload.
   - Establish finance ledger basics (fee catalog, payment receipts).
2. **Academic Core (Milestone 2)**
   - Classes, subjects, enrollment, attendance, assessment entry.
   - Performance computation service; student dashboards.
3. **Financial Expansion (Milestone 3)**
   - Dues, medical fees, sanctions workflows.
   - Payroll module with salary components and reports.
4. **Experience Enhancements (Milestone 4)**
   - E-library, assignments, question bank, notifications.
   - Report card automation, analytics dashboards.
5. **Optimization & Integrations (Milestone 5)**
   - API endpoints for partners, data import/export tooling.
   - Audit logs, advanced search, custom reporting.

## 8. Security and Compliance Considerations
- Enforce least-privilege access with RBAC and resource-level permissions.
- Encrypt sensitive fields (medical info, salaries) at rest; TLS in transit.
- Comply with local privacy laws (e.g., NDPR, GDPR) via consent management and data retention policies.
- Provide disaster recovery via automated backups and replication.

## 9. Metrics and Success Criteria
- **Operational**: onboarding time per student/staff, time-to-publish results, payment reconciliation time.
- **Adoption**: daily active users per role, percentage of modules actively used.
- **Outcomes**: reduction in outstanding fees, improved attendance reporting accuracy, faster payroll cycles.

## 10. Next Steps
- Validate data model with stakeholders and refine edge cases (part-time staff, special programs).
- Produce UI wireframes aligned with journeys above.
- Prioritize MVP scope against timeline and available engineering resources.
